This is a simple WPF application that displays data from rFactor 1 based games. It currently displays a visual representation of the engine RPMs, the current gear, water temperature, oil temperature, remaining fuel, and tire or brake temperatures. A settings window allowing the user to change the units of measure can be displayed by right clicking in the window.
